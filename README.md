What is freeCodeCamp?

freeCodeCamp is a community of millions of people around the world who are learning to code together. You can learn to code with free online courses, programming projects, and interview preparation for developer jobs. We're a 501(c)(3) public charity.

There mission is to help people learn to code for free. We accomplish this by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public. We also have thousands of freeCodeCamp study groups around the world.
